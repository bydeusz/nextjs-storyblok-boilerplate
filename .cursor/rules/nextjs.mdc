# Next.js Project Structure Guidelines

## Directory Organization

- Use the App Router pattern with src/app directory
- Organize routes logically with nested folders
- Use route groups (folders in parentheses) for logical organization without affecting URL structure
- Keep page components focused on layout and composition, not business logic

## API Routes

- Place API routes in app/api directory
- Organize API routes to mirror frontend routes when applicable
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns like authentication

## State Management

- Use React Context for global state when needed
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- Use URL state for shareable UI state
- Consider using tanstack query for client side caching to minimize api calls

## File Naming Conventions

- Use page.tsx for route components
- Use layout.tsx for layout components
- Use loading.tsx for loading states
- Use error.tsx for error states
- Use not-found.tsx for 404 pages
- Use route.tsx for API routes
- Use middleware.ts for middleware

## Configuration

- Keep Next.js configuration in next.config.ts
- Use environment variables with proper typing
- Configure image domains for next/image

## Static Assets

- Place static assets in the public directory
- Use the src/assets directory for imported assets
- Optimize images with next/image
- Use next/font for font optimization
